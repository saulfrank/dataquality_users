"Mr. Orie Lind","Sainsbury's is the second largest chain of supermarkets in the United Kingdom,[2] with a 16.9% share of the UK supermarket sector.[3] Founded in 1869, by John James Sainsbury with a shop in Drury Lane, London, the company became the largest grocery retailer in 1922, was an early adopter of self-service retailing in the UK, and had its heyday during the 1980s. In 1995, Tesco overtook Sainsbury's to become the market leader, and Asda became the second largest in 2003, demoting Sainsbury's to third place for most of the subsequent period until 2014, when Sainsbury's regained second place.[4] The holding company, J Sainsbury plc, is split into three divisions: Sainsbury's Supermarkets Ltd (including convenience stores), Sainsbury's Bank and Sainsbury's Argos. The group's head office is in the Sainsbury's Store Support Centre in Holborn Circus, City of London.[5] The group also has interests in property.","02039 253458","Mr.  Orie  Lind","sainsburysisthesecondlargestchainofsupermarketsintheunitedkingdom,2witha16.9%shareoftheuksupermarketsector.3foundedin1869,byjohnjamessainsburywithashopindrurylane,london,thecompanybecamethelargestgroceryretailerin1922,wasanearlyadopterofself-serviceretai","02039 253458","[ ""A1"", ""A2"", ""A4"" ]","","TRUE","",NA
